# Changelog

## alpha 2

### Bug Fixes (seed generator)

* Gem Cup Warp Pad Shuffle
  * Reduced the chance of the seed generator crashing when shuffling gem cup warp pads from ~32% to ~18%

### Bug Fixes (base mod)

* Gem Cups
  * Exiting out of a gem cup, or losing a gem cup, should no longer place the player into an unloaded hub. This only happened if gem cup warp pads were shuffled into locations outside of Gemstone Valley.
