# CTR-Randomizer Standalone

This tool is a standalone seed generator for the [CTR-Randomizer](https://github.com/icebound777/CTR-Randomizer) mod that randomizes the videogame Crash Team Racing, originally released in 1999 for Sony Playstation.

## Playing the randomizer

To play the randomizer, you will need a ROM of the NTSC-U version of CTR in `.bin` format, as well as an emulator for the Playstation (or a modded PSX / PS2 console).

To generate your own randomizer seeds, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/icebound777/CTR-Randomizer-Standalone/releases) and download the latest executable applicable to your operating system.

The tool will allow you to verify you have the correct ROM, lets you choose your preferred randomization settings, and creates the seed for you. Your original ROM will stay untouched, and instead a copy of it will get placed into the same directory and will be patched into your randomized ROM.

Then just load the randomized ROM into your emulator (or console) of choice, and start your engines!
